## Welcome to Challenge 4

Welcome to the fourth challenge for the Open Source September Challenge. 
Today's challenge is to cover how to Update the Forked Repo From the Original Repo. 


The main repository has been updated since the last fork that all of you created. The goal is to update the forked repository with the changes made in the original repository. This can be done with the git command of ``git remote add upstream``

Resources: 
1. Learn about syncing a fork [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)

2. Learn about how to configure a remote for a fork [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)


Task
1. Update your forked repository locally with the content of the [original repository](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge) for both the main branch and the branch that you created in Challenge 3 using the ``git remote add upstream`` command
2. Once the changes in the forked repository and the original repository are synced in the git branch that you created in the 3rd Challenge, Add a new comment to the issue you created in the [first task](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge1.md). The comment should have the following:
